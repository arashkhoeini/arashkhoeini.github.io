For example, periods of calm with small price changes are often followed by periods of high activity with big jumps. This phenomenon, called volatility clustering, is common in financial data. To model and predict these fluctuations, we use something called a GARCH model. In this blog post, I’ll break down wh... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Exploring AI for Finance, A New Chapter in My Research Journey</title><link href="https://arashkhoeini.github.io/posts/ai-in-finance/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Exploring AI for Finance, A New Chapter in My Research Journey" /><published>2025-01-03T17:30:00-08:00</published> <updated>2025-01-03T17:30:00-08:00</updated> <id>https://arashkhoeini.github.io/posts/ai-in-finance/</id> <content src="https://arashkhoeini.github.io/posts/ai-in-finance/" /> <author> <name>Arash Khoeini</name> </author> <category term="insight" /> <summary> As an AI researcher, I’ve always been fascinated by how machine learning and artificial intelligence can solve complex, real-world problems. Recently, I’ve found myself drawn to a new area of exploration: AI for finance. It’s a topic that blends advanced algorithms with the dynamic, high-stakes world of financial markets, and I think there’s a lot of potential here to make a meaningful impact. ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>The Bitter Truth About AI; Why Human Ingenuity Often Loses to Computation</title><link href="https://arashkhoeini.github.io/posts/the-bitter-lession/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Bitter Truth About AI; Why Human Ingenuity Often Loses to Computation" /><published>2024-02-02T15:00:00-08:00</published> <updated>2024-07-24T12:10:21-07:00</updated> <id>https://arashkhoeini.github.io/posts/the-bitter-lession/</id> <content src="https://arashkhoeini.github.io/posts/the-bitter-lession/" /> <author> <name>Arash Khoeini</name> </author> <category term="insight" /> <summary> This blog post is written based on Rich Sutton’s article, “The Bitter Lesson”. Ah, the fascinating world of artificial intelligence! It’s a place where robots don’t exactly plot world domination (we hope) but are, instead, honing their skills in chess, Go, and even understanding human speech. Let’s dive into the AI rabbit hole through Rich Sutton’s thought-provoking article, “The Bitter Lesso... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>FTTransformer; Transformer Architecture for Tabular Datasets</title><link href="https://arashkhoeini.github.io/posts/FTTransformer/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="FTTransformer; Transformer Architecture for Tabular Datasets" /><published>2024-02-02T15:00:00-08:00</published> <updated>2024-07-17T18:35:17-07:00</updated> <id>https://arashkhoeini.github.io/posts/FTTransformer/</id> <content src="https://arashkhoeini.github.io/posts/FTTransformer/" /> <author> <name>Arash Khoeini</name> </author> <category term="Paper" /> <summary> Introduction If you follow my blog, you’ve probably noticed my keen interest in deep learning for tabular data. It’s not because I find tasks like predicting housing prices fascinating—I don’t! My passion lies in the potential of machine learning to revolutionize personalized medicine. Imagine using a patient’s unique genomic data to provide accurate diagnoses and prognoses. Human genomics is ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Tabular Datasets</title><link href="https://arashkhoeini.github.io/posts/self-supervision_for_tabular-data/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Self-Supervised Representation Learning for Tabular Datasets" /><published>2022-11-18T17:30:00-08:00</published> <updated>2022-11-18T18:57:54-08:00</updated> <id>https://arashkhoeini.github.io/posts/self-supervision_for_tabular-data/</id> <content src="https://arashkhoeini.github.io/posts/self-supervision_for_tabular-data/" /> <author> <name>Arash Khoeini</name> </author> <category term="Tutorial" /> <summary> Self-supervised Learning for Tabular Datasets Self-supervised learning aims to learn latent representations for unlabeled datasets. It has shown to be an effective representation learning method; even outperforming supervised representation learning in some settings, such as Transfer Learning. In the previous blog posts, I covered self-supervised learning and briefly explained various collapsi... </summary> </entry> </feed>
